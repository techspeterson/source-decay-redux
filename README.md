# Source Decay Redux

A recreation of a personal project (originally built on [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/) in vanilla HTML/CSS/JS) using React. Built using [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/).

## To do:
- Build additional pages, implement router
- Element filtering/sorting on certain pages (original version used Isotope.js)
- Implement post search function
- Implement more robust blog interface/database
- Clean up CSS, finish separating by component
- Other new features (???)
